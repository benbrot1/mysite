    <p>
      I'm Nobody! Who are you?<br>
      Are you - Nobody - Too?<br>
      Then there's a pair of us!<br>
      Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!
    </p>
    <p>
      How dreary - to be - Somebody!<br>
      How public - like a Frog -<br>
      To tell one's name - the livelong June -<br>
      To an admiring Bog!
